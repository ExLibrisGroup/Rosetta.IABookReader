IABookReader
============
• Description 
The IA Book Reader is an External Viewer that can be integrated with Rosetta.
This viewer can show images (JPEG, JP2) in the form of book pages, which makes it
a great option for delivering scanned books.

We recommend using an external application server. Ex Libris does not guarantee future changes to the Rosetta JBoss AS will be compatible with the player.
If you do deploy the viewer on an external server, you will need to configure the viewer.properties file situated under the conf folder: change localhost to your Rosetta server name.

The BookReaderViewerPreProcessor.jar should be deployed as a plug-in. For instructions look at this
